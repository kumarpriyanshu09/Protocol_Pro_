Follow the Protocol Pro App Flow Document for navigation and feature flows.
Implement each feature flow as a separate module for easy removal or disabling.
Use mock data and simulated interactions (e.g., console logs, alerts) for preview mode.
Ensure smooth page transitions with fade-in/fade-out or slide animations.
