# Cursor Documentation Parsing Rules

## Objective
Instruct Cursor to recursively traverse the `docs/` folder and its subdirectories, reading and aggregating information from all Markdown (`.md`) files. These documents include guidelines, readme files, and component-specific documentation (e.g., Architecture, Development).

## Scope
- **Files:** All files ending with `.md` located in the `docs/` folder and any of its subfolders.
- **Folders:** Includes but is not limited to:
  - `docs/architecture`
  - `docs/development`
  - `docs/guidelines`
  - Any additional subfolders that contain project documentation.

## Process
1. **Traversal:**  
   - Recursively search the `docs/` folder for all `.md` files.
   - Log the path and filename of each document encountered.

2. **Parsing Each Document:**  
   - **Headings:** Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to understand the document structure.
   - **Content Extraction:**  
     - Extract key sections, best practices, guidelines, and code examples.
     - Treat code blocks as contextual examples.
   - **Metadata:**  
     - If metadata (such as document title, author, or date) is present, capture it for reference.
   - **Cross-References:**  
     - Note any references to other documents or sections that might require cross-checking.

3. **Aggregation:**  
   - Summarize the key points from each document.
   - Organize the summaries based on their folder context (e.g., architectural guidelines vs. development practices).
   - Generate a final aggregated summary that can be used for future code generation or improvement suggestions.

## Special Considerations
- **Non-Text Elements:**  
  - Ignore images or media files that are embedded in the Markdown; focus solely on textual content.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - If a file fails to parse, log an error with the file path and continue with other files.
- **Environment:**  
  - This rule is intended for internal documentation review in non-production environments.

## Output
- **Per-File Summary:**  
  - For each document, output a summary including its main sections and any critical guidelines.
- **Aggregated Report:**  
  - Compile an overall report detailing:
    - The total number of files processed.
    - Key themes and guidelines extracted.
    - Any notable cross-references or dependencies mentioned across documents.

## Logging & Debugging
- Log each file path and parsing result.
- Include a summary log of files that encountered errors or could not be fully processed.

## Update Frequency
- Run these rules whenever changes occur in the `docs/` folder to ensure the aggregated documentation remains current.
