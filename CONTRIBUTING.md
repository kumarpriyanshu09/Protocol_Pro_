### 2. Pick an Issue

- Choose an issue from the issue tracker
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
- If you want to work on something that doesn't have an issue yet, create one first

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a branch with a descriptive name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-login
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-navigation
```

### 4. Make Changes

Follow our [development guidelines](./docs/development/README.md) when making changes:

- Follow the code style guidelines
- Write tests for your changes
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Add comments to functions
- Use TypeScript for type safety

### 5. Document Your Changes

Update documentation to reflect your changes:

- Update relevant README files
- Update API documentation if applicable
- Update UI component documentation if applicable
- Create Mermaid diagrams for architectural changes

### 6. Create a Pull Request

- Push your branch to the repository
- Create a pull request with a descriptive title and description
- Include screenshots or videos for UI changes
- Link to the issue(s) being addressed
- Include a Mermaid diagram for architectural changes

### 7. Code Review

- All pull requests require at least one review
- Address review feedback
- Keep the pull request focused on a single issue

## Documentation

We value comprehensive documentation. When contributing:

- Update documentation with code changes
- Follow the documentation templates
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include diagrams for complex concepts

## Testing

All code should be tested:

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update tests when changing existing functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request

## AI-Assisted Development

When using AI tools like GitHub Copilot or Claude:

- Review all AI-generated code before committing
- Test AI-generated code thoroughly
- Refactor AI-generated code to match project style
- You are responsible for any AI-generated code you commit

# Protocol Pro Documentation

Welcome to the Protocol Pro documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the Protocol Pro application, its architecture, development guidelines, and more.

## Documentation Structure

- **[Getting Started](./getting-started)**: Instructions for setting up and running the application
- **[Architecture](./architecture)**: Information about the application architecture
- **[Development](./development)**: Development guidelines and best practices
- **[API](./api)**: API documentation
- **[UI](./ui)**: UI component documentation
- **[Product](./product)**: Product requirements and specifications

## Contributing to Documentation

Documentation is an essential part of the Protocol Pro project. If you find any issues or want to improve the documentation, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation Best Practices

When contributing to documentation:

1. **Use clear, concise language**: Avoid jargon and complex sentences
2. **Include examples**: Provide practical examples to illustrate concepts
3. **Use diagrams**: Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex relationships
4. **Keep documentation up-to-date**: Update documentation when making code changes
5. **Cross-reference**: Link to related documentation to provide context
```

# Getting Started with Protocol Pro

This guide will help you set up your development environment and get started with Protocol Pro.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 10 or higher
- Expo CLI (optional, but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd protocol-pro
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install all workspace dependencies
npm run install:all
```

## Development Environment

### Running the Mobile App

To start the development server for the mobile app:

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run start

# Or navigate to the mobile app directory
cd monorepo/apps/mobile
npx expo start
```

This will launch the Expo development server, and you can run the app on:
- iOS simulator (press `i`)
- Android emulator (press `a`)
- Web browser (press `w`)
- Physical device using the Expo Go app (scan the QR code)

## Project Structure

### Monorepo Structure

Protocol Pro uses a monorepo architecture with the following structure:
