## High-Level Workflow for "Protocol Pro"

### User Workflow (Followers)
1. **Launch App:** Users open the app, encountering a login screen. After entering credentials, they are directed to the "Follower Dashboard" if authenticated as a follower.
2. **View Dashboard:** The dashboard displays the current protocol (e.g., "30-Day Fitness Challenge"), progress visuals (bar chart, line chart, Apple Screen Time-style bar chart), and a task list with checkboxes.
3. **Track Progress:** Users mark tasks as complete, updating progress visuals in real-time (locally for preview mode).
4. **View Overview:** Users navigate to the "User Overview" screen to see insights like "What's Working" and "Bottlenecks" based on their progress.
5. **Navigate Sections:** A bottom navigation bar allows switching between "Dashboard," "Journal," "Messages," and "Settings."

### Instructor Workflow
1. **Launch App:** Instructors log in and are directed to the "Instructor Dashboard."
2. **View Dashboard:** The dashboard lists protocols, summarizes follower progress (e.g., total followers at 80%+ completion), and offers options to create protocols or view the user overview.
3. **Create Protocol:** Instructors access the "Protocol Creation" screen to define new protocols with titles and steps.
4. **Monitor Followers:** Instructors view individual follower progress and aggregated insights in the "User Overview."
5. **Provide Feedback:** Instructors use the "Messages" tab for mock communication with followers (static for preview).

## Replit Preview Considerations

### Tools to Add for Preview
Yes, you should specify basic front-end tools to ensure a functional preview without complicating it or requiring dependencies:
- **HTML:** Structure with `<div>` tags for top bar, header, content, and navigation (e.g., `<div class="top-bar">`, `<div class="content">`).
- **CSS:** Use plain CSS for styling (e.g., `background-color: #FFFFFF`, `color: #0070f3`, `border-radius: 10px`) or Tailwind CSS if preferred in Replit.
- **JavaScript:** Add simple interactivity (e.g., `document.getElementById('task1').addEventListener('change', updateProgress)` to adjust bar width).
- **Why Not Complicated:** These tools are lightweight, static, and require no external dependencies or API keys, keeping the preview simple and focused.

### Anything Missing for Replit to Create the Preview
Assuming you haven’t started in Replit yet, the following are missing:
- **Complete HTML Structure:** Files like `index.html` with all screens (Login, Follower Dashboard, Instructor Dashboard, Protocol Creation, User Overview).
- **CSS Styling:** A `styles.css` file with precise rules (e.g., `.progress-bar { width: 50%; background: #0070f3; }`, `.nav-bar { background: #F0F0F0; }`).
- **JavaScript Logic:** A `script.js` file with functions for checkbox toggles (e.g., update bar width) and navigation (e.g., show/hide sections).
- **Mock Data:** Hardcoded values for protocols, tasks, and progress percentages.

### Anything Added Using Replit Till Now
Since you haven’t specified what’s been added, I assume nothing exists yet. If you’ve started, please note gaps (e.g., missing CSS for habit cards, no JavaScript for interactions), and I can adjust accordingly. For now:
- Start with a blank Replit project.
- Add `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

## Every Small Element to Add
- **Login Screen:** `<input type="email">`, `<input type="password">`, `<button>Login</button>`, `<button>Sign Up</button>`, `<a>Forgot Password?</a>`.
- **Top Bar:** `<div>` with `<span>5:57</span>`, `<img>` for signal, Wi-Fi, battery icons (gray, 20px).
- **Header:** `<h1>` with text (e.g., "Follower Dashboard").
- **Progress Visuals:**
  - Bar Chart: `<div class="progress-bar">` styled with width and color.
  - Line Chart: `<svg>` with `<polyline>` for 5 points.
  - Apple Screen Time Chart: Three `<div>` bars with heights and labels.
- **Task List:** `<ul>` with `<li><input type="checkbox">Task Name</li>`.
- **Navigation Bar:** `<nav>` with four `<div>`s, each containing `<img>` (icon) and `<span>` (label).
- **Buttons:** `<button>` with text (e.g., "Create Protocol"), styled with color and padding.
- **Overview Text:** `<p>` tags for "What's Working" and "Bottlenecks."
